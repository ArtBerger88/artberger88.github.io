    <p id="about-me">About Me:<br> I am Art Berger, <br>I grew up in Inverness, went to Inverness Middle School and Citrus High. Moving to Ohio mid high school and graduating from Pickaway-Ross CTC with a Carpentry Certification. Returning back to Inverness after high school in 07', I started working as a apprentice Spray Technitian at Rainbow Springs Golf and Country Club.<br> This proved to be a great interest to me.<br>I returned back to Ohio and furthured my landscaping knowledge, working at a couple commercial landscaping companies and learning the trade inside and out. I am a liscenced Spray Technitian through the Department of Agriculture for Ohio, I've held this liscence for the last 8 years.<br> I consider myself a lawn engineer, just cutting grass doesnt quite describe my <strong>'Works of Art'</strong>. <br>I take pride in my every job and the percision and artistic ability I present through it.<br> With this expertise and knowledge I return back home to Citrus County to start my own Start-up landscaping company -<strong>"The Art of Lawn Care"</strong><br>I am not your average mow guy, I am the exception.</p>
