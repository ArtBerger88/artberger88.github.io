    <p id="about-me-text">About Me:</p>
    <p id="about-me">I am <strong>Art Berger</strong>, <br>I grew up in Inverness, went to IMS and Citrus High School. After school I started working as an apprentice Spray Technitian at Rainbow Springs Golf and Country Club.<br>I furthured my landscaping knowledge honing my craft, working at a couple commercial landscaping companies and learning the trade inside and out.<br> I then became a <strong>liscenced</strong> Spray Technitian with certifications in turfgrass, pest, and ornamenal weeds through the Department of Agriculture for Ohio, I've held this liscence for the last 8 years.<br><br> I consider myself a <strong>Lawn Engineer</strong>, just cutting grass doesn't quite describe my <strong>'Works of Art'</strong>. <br>I take pride in my every job and the percision and artistic ability I present through it.<br> With this expertise and knowledge I return back home to Citrus County to start my own landscaping company -<strong>"The Art of Lawn Care"</strong><br>I am not your average mowing and landscape guy, I am the exception.</p>
